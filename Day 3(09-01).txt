Why interface added in java?

->Multiple inheritance

nothing is inherited if we use interface.

interface means must implement the methods

->interface is more secure. It hide the implementation details to client.

in interface and final variables must be initialized.

By default the interface variables are public static variables.
By default the interface methods are public abstract method.


constructor vs Methods:-
-----------------------

Same of class name                  any name
called when object created          Called after object created
Must not have return type           Must have return type


constructor and method may have same name

similarities:-
------------
Exception handling
Return
Any logic



Abstract class     vs                            Interface
--------------                                   ---------
=> Methods with body as well as without body         Only abstract methods(without body)

=>Has variables which can be modified              only final variables

=>Can have instance variables                      Only static variables

=>Doesn't Support multiple inheritance             Support MI

=>Variables/methods can have various access modifiers      only public variables/methods

=>Can have constructor                         Don't have constructor


interface is faster than abstract class



Marker Interface:-
-----------------
marker interface are empty.
Eg: Serializable,Cloneable,Remote

interface A{
}

Functional interface:-
---------------------
It has only one abstract method
Eg:Runnable,Comparable

interface A{
	public void abc();
}
