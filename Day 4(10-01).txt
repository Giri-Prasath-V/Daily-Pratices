Access Modifiers:-
----------------

public :-

if class is declared as public it can be access by all the class in the same package and also access by classes in another packages.

Cannot mention the class as private or protected. Only mention as public or nothing.


private:-

only in that class

protected:-

everyone in the same packages can access + the class refered (directly or indirectly) to it

default -> packet scope (if we don't mention scope it take as default scope)

There is no default keyword as an access modifier. if we need to make it default then no access specifier is mentioned

import:-
-------
import is use it will only import the only that package class not import its subpackages class

Packages:-
--------

-d is used while compile if use use any package
Eg: javac -d . A.java

Run : java packagename.classname


if the class is not mention as public then it is not access by another package.


when it is protected then don't create an object to access in its subclass.

constructor can be public,private or protected

Non access modifiers:-
--------------------

            Variables           Classes          Methods  

abstract -> no                   yes              yes
  
static ->   yes                  no               yes             

final  ->   yes                  yes              yes


static block code executed at the time of loading beforing running main block. 
If we have more static block then it join and execute it.(done by complier)

final variable are constant.
final class cannot be inherited.
final methods cannot be overridden.


In abstract class there is 0 or more abstract methods.
For abstract class we can't create object
The abstract method in abstract call it must be implemented in non abstract subclass.
Pure abstract class all the methods are abstract.
Abstract method must be overridden by subclass.

Static variable are shared by all the objects.
We can access the static variable without creating objects.
Static methods are called without creating object.
If we declare a method as static then we call the class without any instances. 
Static methods can only access the static variable directly.
Static method only call/invoke the static methods
Static class in terminology all the variables and methods are static. Eg: Math class,System,collections.


Assignment:

class Emp{}
class clerk {}
class Pro {}
class Manager{}

No one should be able to inherite from clerk,pro,manager
display method cannot be override
Keep all class in emp.assignment package.

1. Create
2. Display
3. Raise Salary
4. Remove
5. Exit
-------------------
Enter choice :- 4
Enter emp id : 55
name
age
salary
design
Do you really want to remove this employee record (Y/N) : N
