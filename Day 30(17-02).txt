Spring Core:-
------------

Difference between DI and IOC: 
 Dependency Injection DI : object is depend on other then that object is created and injected. It is one of the pattern.
 Inversion of Control IOC : It is a principle. I tell some one to create or do the job.

DI Types:-
	* Constructor Injection
	* Setter Injection
	* Field Injection
IOC types:-
	* BeanFactory
	* ApplicationContext

Spring Boot:-
------------
It is a modern way of creating spring

Features : 
	* Autoconfiguration : Perform multiple annotation by using a single annotation 
	* Spring Initializr/Starter Kit : Only need to mention the springboot version. No need to give its sub packages version.
	* Embedded Server
	* Inbuilt H2 DB
	* Actuators


* By default the scope of program is singleton and it is early instantiated.
* Need to mention it as prototype.
* In prototype by default it is lazy instantiation

@Lazy => no object created early. When we call only it create a singleton objects
